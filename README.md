Marketing Page for International Child Nutrition Status Tracking

# Pitch: There are a lot of child malnutrition nonprofits around the globe. It’s difficult to keep track of all the data for thousands of kids that are screened. This apps allows their data to be entered and saved, and tracked over time. It keeps records organized by both country name and community name.  

# MVP: 
-Onboarding for a new admin user (permission over all countries, and the ability to add additional admin accounts and country specific accounts)
-Onboarding for a new country specific user (can only add child records to the country they are added to)
-Ability to create a new country for adding child records to. 
-Within a country’s page, ability for user to add a new child screening record. Fields should include child’s name, parent name and contact info, date of screening, location of screening (both country name and community name) date of birth, (auto populate the child’s age in months based on the entered date of birth), gender, height (cm), and weight (kg). 
-Homepage should show a list of all the countries. Clicking on a country shows a list of communities where screenings have taken place. Clicking on a community shows a list of children screened. 
-Page to view an individual child. If they have multiple screening instances, show a graph of their weight over time. 

# Stretch: Ability to download an excel sheet of all records for a specific screening date.
